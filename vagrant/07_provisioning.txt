1. We know that developer can run vagrant up and can have complete dev environment as configured in Vagrantfile
2. The env should have all the necessary softwares required for the project
  a. we can bake the software in the box itself
  b. we can install software at the part of env creation process - Vagranfile. This is Provisioning.


We have base Vagrant box is there. We need to install software. We will do this by automatic provisioning. This is done when we run 'vagrant up'. Provisioners can be shell script, chef, puppet or plug-ins.

Install Apache
1. Manually
   In Vagrantfile, configure port forwarding port guest(80) -> host(8080)
   vagrant up
   vagrant status
   vagrant ssh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -year
   apache2
   sudo rm -rf /var/www
   sudo ln -fs /vagrant /var/www
   exit
   ls  (i am in directory where Vagrantfile is)
   echo "<strong>HTML</string>" > index.html

   vagranr ssh
   cd /vagrant
   ls
   exit

   localhost:8080 on local host machine's browser

2. Provisioning using shell script
   vagrant status (VM is running)
   vagrant destroy
   I am in my project directory

vim provision.sh
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   echo "Installing Apache and setting apache up... please wait"
   apt-get update >/dev/null 2>&1
   apt-get install -y apache2 >/dev/null 2>&1
   rm -rf /var/www
   ln -fs /vagrant /var/www

In Vagrantfile,
   config.vm.provision "shell", path: "provision.sh"

3. Provisioning using chef
   chef is build by opscode. Vagrant has build in support for provisioning with chef.
   We can use chef-solo: uses local cookbooks for provisioning
   or chef-client: will connect to chef-server to download cookbook and use run-list

In Vagrantfile,
   config.vm.provision "chef_solo" do |chef|
     chef.add_recipe "vagrant_la"
   end

chef needs a particular folder structure
mkdir -p cookbooks/vagrant_la/recipes
cd cookbooks/vagrant_la/recipies
vim default.rb
execute "apt-get update"
package "apache2"
execute "rm -rf /var/www"
link "/var/www" do
  to "/vagrant"
end

cd - (go to project folder containg Vagrantfile)
vagrant destroy (if running)
vagrant_up (start VM using chef recipe)
