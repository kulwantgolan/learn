Types of chef server:
---------------------
1. Open Source chef server
	- free version
	- each instance of server must be configured and managed locally
	- only one organisation is possible
	- Cannot integrate with AD/LDAP
2. Chef-server enterprise (hosted)
	-Scalable
	-Organisations is available
	-Always Available
	- Resource-based access control
	-Can integrate with AD and LDAP
3. Chef-server enterprise (on-premise)  ---> 
	-Scalable
	-Organisations is avalable
	-Hosted on-premise behind your firewall
	-Manage yourself

Orgamisation
-------------
One organisation is completely isolated from other organisation.
Different infrastructure, policies and cookbooks.

For each organisation we need starter kit to bootrsrap node, the kit contains
1.  chef-repo : contain .chef folder that contains
	validation.pem keys (passwd to node so that they can authenticate against chef server)
	knife.rb  --> used by knife tool, location of chef server; user.pem location; cookbook location
	user.pem --> called client key
However, if u download a new starter kit:
	-it generates new security keys. Therefore, it should be distributed to other team members.

Role of chef-server
-------------------
1. Chef server stores sytem configuration information:
	Policies for nodes
	Recipes
	Cookbooks
	Databags
	Templates
	Attribute file
2. it also authenticate workstaion - upload condiguration
3. it also authenticate node - node should have key
	node check in to chef-server and download configuration (node desired state)
	node then, based on configurations supplied by server, the node configures itself
