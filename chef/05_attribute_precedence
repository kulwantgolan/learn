Attribute precedence
--------------------
1. Attributes are specific info about a node
2. Attribute describe:
	current state of node
	state before chef-client run and state after chef-client run

3. Attribute can be defined in multiple places.
	ohai - describe state of node - cannot be changed/overwrite by us 
	cookbook's attribute file
	Roles and Environment

4. chef-client run
	load current node object from server
	run ohai node object
	load attributes comming from recipies env and role
	determine conflicts are choose attributes based on precedence level
	create node object - container of attribute info
	copies node obj to chef-server - now knife can use it

5.		Attribute file -- node/recipie ----environment --- role

force-default		5		6
normal			7		8
override		9		10		11		12
