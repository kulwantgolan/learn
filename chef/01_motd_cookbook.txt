Create motd cookbook
------------------------
start 2 VMs - one is workstation, one is node

1. #rename hostname of workstation VM to workstation
hostname workstation
exec bash

2. check connectivity between 2 VMs

3. on node, ssh into this machine and make sure that root user can login
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin yes
Later on, Disable it after chef-bootstraped on this node
service sshd restart  #for ubuntu it will be ssh restart

4. We need account setup on enterprise chef server,
(allow 5 nodes)
getchef.com -> sign up... login to management console
create organisation - is unique 

5. On workstation,
each organistion have a starter kit(NOTE: every time u download it, the security keys are reset):
 -> Download chef-repo
 -> security certificated that allow communication between wokstation -- chef server -- nodes
it is chef-starter.zip
mv chef-starter.zip ~/
unzip ched-started.zip
cd chef-repo

6. you need to install chef software manually on workstation
-> knife tool
root@workstation# curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | bash

7. We have chef and chef-repo for our organisation. Now, bootstrap a node
-> install required chef stuff on it, chef-client, chef-tools
-> Allows the node to automatically authenticate with chef-server
-> node is added to chef enterprise server
root@workstation# knife bootstarp <IP Address> -x root -P passwordonnode 

8. On node,
chef-client   #will do convergence - check anything server have to serve

9. Now can write policies:
On workstation,
Inside chef repo,
knife cookbook create motd
# we have cookbooks/motd  --> recipes templates attributes
vim cookbooks/motd/recipes/default.rb
template "/etc/motd" do
 source "motd.erb"
 mode "0644"
end
#look in templates dir for template name motd.erb, take this template and create /etc/motd file (replace it if exist) and set permission on file 0644
Now, cd ../templates/default
vim motd.erb
This is MOTD created by  <%= node["motd"]["author"] %>
# this is  attribute
cd in attributes  - default.rb
Define attribute and presendence 
default["motd"]["author"] = "Kulwant"

10. Now, upload cookbook to Server
knife cookbook upload motd  

11. On node, run chef-client  (nothing happens)
We node to define this node have to run this recipe.
knife node run_list add nodename "recipe[motd]"  --> Adds default.rb recipe from motd cookbook.

cd /var/chef --> backup folder or previous file
cd /etc/motd --> new file
