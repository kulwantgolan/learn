Roles   -> better way to assign recipe to node
-----------

A way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organisation 
as belonging to a single job function

What we have done till now: Added recipies to each node's run list
Instead
1. We update a role on chef server; role contains attributes and runlist of recipies to run
2. Attributes defined in a role has its own level of precedence
So, we need not to manually touch each node that required a run list change

Concept is Instead of providing run-list to a node, we assign the node a role.

If we have a recipie that needs to be run on all node regardless of their role, e.g. security recipe - we create a base role and add this role in other role's run list

Role management with Knife
--------------------------
knife role create role_name
chef-repo/roles/rolename.rb
knife role from file chef-repo/roles/rolename.rb
knife role list -w (view list of roles on chef server)
knife role delete role_name

Create web server role - assign it to node 
Have a run list of recipies associated with the role
---------------------------------------------------
In workstation, chef-repo#mkdir roles
vim webserver.rb
name "webserver"
description "apache web server role"
run_list "recipe[apache]","recipe[localusers]"

knife role fom webserver.rb
remove the recipies from targeted node run list -> using web server
knife node run_list add nodename "role[webserver]" ---> assign role(instead of recipe) to node

Now, run chef-client on node

Add more recipes to role
In workstation, roles webserver.rb #run_list "recipe[apache]","recipe[localusers]", "recipe[security]"
knife role fom webserver.rb

We will create mysql cookbook, add a mysql role to a node
---------------------------------------------------------
In workstation, chef-repo# cd cookbooks
knife cookbook create mysql
vim recipes/default.rb

package "mysql-server" do  --> install mysql server
end
package "mysql" do  --> install mysql client
end 

knife cookbook upload mysql

we need to have root user login enable to bootstart a node
On node, vi /etc/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin yes
service sshd restart
knife bootstarp ip-address-of-node -x root -P 123456    ----> it is going to bootstarap with FQDN and it will be unique

We have a new node that is just bootrap, we need to give it mysql role
----------------------------------------------------------------

chef-repo#roles/database.rb
name "database"
description "mysql description"
run_list "recipe[mysql]"

knife role from file database.rb

Tell node that it's role is webserver - we need to do it once only
knife node run_list add nodename "role[database]"


Create a Base role
------------------
A recipe that need to run on say 10 roles.
Ans: we can create a role and include it into another role's run-list

Create a role base.rb
name "base"
description "run on all nodes"
run_list "recipe[security]"

Add base role to all roles - in their run list

Now we have to update our base role to modify all nodes.

knife role from file webserver.rb
knife role from file database.rb
knife role from file base.rb
