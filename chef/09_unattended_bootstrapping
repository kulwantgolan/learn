Normal workflow
-----------------

1. Nodes should be bootstarp and managed from workstation  --> we can use batch scripting to bootstrap multiple nodes
2. Nodes should be assigned roles and environments
3. Attributes specif to role/env should be configured automatically


BUT in Auto-scaling environments
----------------------------------
such as AWS , we need unattended bootstrapping

For unattended bootstap the node should meet the following criteria:
1. Must be able to authenticate to web server
2. Must be able to configure a run_list  --> node should be able to assign itself the desired role which in turn contain run_list
3. must be able to access chef-validator.pem. So, that it may create client.pem and identity on chef server  --> clould init (called USER DATA in AWS)allow us to pass bash script to machine image at boot time. bash script can download .pem file and client.rb from say S3 bucket
4. must have unique node name
5. client.rb should have proper configuration so that it know what chef-server to communicate with
6. modify file.json in /etc/chef --> to include run_list for the node 

Then chef-client will execute for the first time.
