Environment
-----------

It is used to map organisation's real life workflow to chef server
1. Apply different cookbook version to specific env - dev/prod/staging
	we want to test some recipies in staging without affecting production env
2. Can define environment level attributes --> set environment specific application  (paypal API url and credential will be different for staging and prod env)
3. It allow sharing of cookbooks within organisation

Create environment
-------------------
1. it is stored in JSON file / .rb file and is located in chef-repo/environments
2. example dev.rb
name "dev"
description "Devlopment enviornment"
cookbook "security","=0.1.0"       -----> it is not run list of node but the cookbook version requirement if it is in run list
cookbook "motd", "=0.2.0"
cookbook "apache","=0.2.0"
override_attributes({
	"author" => { "name" => true }
	})


Attributes precedence in env:
-----------------------
1. Override has higher precedence than default , force_default and normal
2. default attribute in env will take precedence over a default defined in cookbook attribute file

Assign node to an environemt
-----------------------
By default, all nodes are added to _default environment
All nodes must belong to an environment

1. Assign it manually in chef-server GUI
2. use knife plugin called knife-flip 
3. we can modify client.rb file located in /etc/chef directory on node and set env variable = what we want


Goals:
------------
1. Configure the env: dev/prod
2. Modify apache cookbooks with newer version
3. Set newer version for dev and older version for prod
4. Configure Client.rb on node to look for proper environment


In Workstation, chef-repo#
1. we need to configure in workstation and upload to shef-server
mkdir environments
In environments# vim dev.rb
name "dev"
decription "This is dev env"
cookbook "apache", "=0.1.5"  --> metadata.rb of cookbook contain version of cookbook
override_attributes({   ---> default_attributes would also override default attribute in cookbook/recipe
	"author" => {
		"name" => "my new author name"       ----> it will override attribute in cookbook default["author"]["name"] = "my authorname"
	}
	Can also potentially define API credentials/ dev url for code here
})


knife environment list -w  --> list all env; and -w show API url for that environment
knife environment from file dev.rb  --> Create env , if we change env , we have to recreate/update it using this command

Change env a node belongs to 
----------------------------
1. manually in chef server
2. Use knife flip plugin from workstation
3. On node, /etc/chef/client.rb
envornment "dev"


Create a second version of apache cookbook -> add an attribute "author", use it in template in index.html.erb
Apply to dev node
------------------------------------------
In workstation, Chef-repo, to to apache cookbooks, attributes/default.rb# 
default["author"]["name"]= "kul"

In recipe, default.rb #
template "/content/sites/#{sitename}/index.html" do
	variables (
		:author_name => node["author"]["name"]
	)
end


In templates, vim index.html.erb,
<h4> <%= @authhor_name %> </h4>

In cookbook, vim metadata.rb
version '0.1.5'

knife cookbook upload apache

How to use 0.1.0 for prod and 0.1.5 or dev  (currently both dev and prod use 0.1.5)
--------------------------------------------
In workstation, In env #prod.rb
name "prod"
description "production env"
cookbook "apache", "=0.1.0"   --> in env u specify which version of cookbook to use

knife environment from file prod.rb

In production node, --> tell node tht it belongs to prod env
/etc/chef/client.rb
environment "prod"

run chef-client

View / Delete Environment with Knife
------------------------------------
knife environment list -w  --> list all env
knife environment compare dev   --> list cookbook constraints in env
knife enironment compare dev prod
knife environment compare --all
knife environment delete dev --> delete an environment from server
knife environment from file dev.rb --> add /update environment
knife environment show dev --> show cookbook ver, attributes of the env
