Data bags - variables of JSON data
---------------------------------

1. Global variable ; stored in json format ; accessible from chef server
2. it is indexed for searching
3. it can be loaded by a recipe ; can be accessed during search

what type of data it holds?
--------------------------
1. Create a recipe that search for specific databag and create users based on data in data bag
2. Admins to be added to sudo
3. API/DB credentials 
	-> more secure than storing them as environment attributes
	-> we can encrpt it upload to a node and decrypt it

example of a databag?
----------------------
{
	"id":"username",
	"comment":"admin user"
	"uid":2005,
	"gid":0,
	"home":"/home/username",
	"shell":"/bin/bash"
}

Create data bags on workstation and upload to chef server
Search databag for specific info using knife tool
---------------------------------------------------------
workstation-chef-repo# mkdir data_bags and cd into it

Task: Deploy Administrative users to our node and give them sudo previleges 
create user and group datbag
#mkdir {users,groups}
users# vim admin.json  -> this data is parsed by recipe
{
	"id":"admin,             --> each databag item needs to have unique id, since the username is unique on linux system , it is used
	"comment":"admin user",
	"uid":"2005",
	"gid":0,
	"home":"/home/admin",
	"shell":"/bin/bash",
	"password":"123456"
}
groups# vim sudoers.json
{
	"id":"sudoers",  ---> On CentOS, if a user belongs to wheel group, they have sudo previleges
	"gid":3005,
	"members":["admin"]
}

knife data bag create users  -> will create databag users on server
knife data bag create groups -> will create databag groups on chef server

knife data_bag from file users admin.json  -> will look inside chef-repo/data_bags/users directory and add specified data items to server
knife data_bag from file groups sudoers.json -> upload data item to data bag on server

Search data bag
-------------------
knife search users "id:admin"  -> knife search in databag name "users" and look for attribute:value pair, show data item
knife search users "id:admin" -a home -> just want to get a particular attribute:value pair for targetted data item

write recipe to use data-bag item
--------------------------------
Create Admin user and assign it to wheel group

knife cookbook create localusers
In localusers/recipies/default.rb
explaination: search(:users,"comment:admin*")    ---> search in databag named "users"; return databag items for matching attribute:value specified

search(:users,"*:*").each do |data|
	user data["id"] do    --------------> using user resource
		comment data["comment"]
		uid data["uid"]
		gid data["gid"]
		home data["home"]
		shell data["shell"]
	end	
end
include_recipe "localusers::groups"  ---> localusers cookbook and groups recipe in it
	--> group recipe will run only if user is added to system. To make the added user to wheel group
	--> both recipies are in same cookbook so no change in metadata required


knife cookbook upload localusers
knife node run_list add nodename "recipe[localusers]"  -->Add recipie to node run list

Now, run chef-client on node
cat /etc/passwd  -> admin user is created


Now, create wheel group
On chef-repo, in localusers cookbook, create another recipe:
vim groups.rb

search(:groups,"*:*").each do |data|
	group data["id"] do    --------------> using group resource
		gid data["gid"]
		members data["members"]
	end	
end

knife cookbook upload localusers

Now, run chef-client on node
groups admin   ---> show 'admin' user is part of wheel group
